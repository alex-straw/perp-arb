Funding rate arbitrage project

Strategy:
Funding rate on a perptual future goes positive, so those holding short positions get paid.
Simultaneously take out a long position (via Uniswap on Arbitrum) to hedge the short on perpetual futures.


SynFutures

Seems like a low liquidity protocol that might have some good arbitrage opportunities.
